## Features

- **Modern JavaScript and TypeScript support** with Babel
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** for efficient development
- **CSS processing** with PostCSS and TailwindCSS
- **Code splitting and optimization** using Rspack
- **Compression** of assets for production
- **Source maps** for easier debugging in development

## Getting Started

To get started with this boilerplate, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
npm install
```

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

## Scripts

This project comes with several scripts to help you with your development and build processes:

- **Clean the build directory:**
  ```bash
  npm run clean
  ```

- **Build for production:**
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- **Start the development server:**
  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

└── webpack.config.js       # Rspack configuration
```

## Development

To start a development server with Hot Module Replacement, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

The development server will be available at `http://localhost:9000`, and changes to your files will automatically reflect in the browser.

## Production Build

To create a production build with optimizations, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized files in the `dist` directory, ready for deployment.
